# Integer Sequence Learning
This is a repository of project developed by @BinaryCat team during uData Crash Course.

## Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/integer-sequence-learning/): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7?!
The goal of this project was to develop stand-alone system that combines several approaches to process a given sequence in order to predict the next term. Dataset was collected from [OEIS Encyclopedia](https://oeis.org/) and tampered a bit, with noise added and some terms randomly removed. Accuracy is used for evaluation, thus penalising heavily for not exact prediction. Best accuracy achived by the combined effort of our team and Kaggle contributors is 25.2%.
